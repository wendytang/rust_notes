Let me explain what's happening in this example:

numbers: [1, 2, 3] - This prints the contents of the Arc, which shows us the vector inside.

&numbers: 0x16d2adda0 - This is the memory address OF the Arc smart pointer itself. When you use &, you're getting a reference to the Arc object.

*numbers: [1, 2, 3] - Using * dereferences the Arc to access the Vec inside. It shows the actual vector contents.

&*numbers: 0x14fe05dd0 - This is particularly interesting! It:

First dereferences the Arc (*numbers) to get to the Vec
Then takes a reference to that Vec (&)
Notice this address is different from &numbers
The most interesting part comes when we clone the Arc:

&numbers2 has a different address (0x16d2ae098) because it's a new Arc instance
But &*numbers2 has the SAME address (0x14fe05dd0) as the original &*numbers!
This demonstrates a key feature of Arc:

Each Arc clone creates a new Arc instance (new smart pointer)
But they all point to the same data on the heap (same Vec)
Visual representation:
